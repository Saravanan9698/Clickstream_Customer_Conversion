🛒 Customer Conversion Analysis Using Clickstream Data
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes clickstream data from an e-commerce platform to predict customer conversions, estimate potential revenue, and segment users for personalized marketing strategies. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project enhances decision-making for businesses aiming to optimize user engagement and sales.

🎯 Objectives
✅ Predict Customer Conversion (Classification):
Determine whether a customer will complete a purchase based on browsing behavior.

💰 Estimate Potential Revenue (Regression):
Forecast expected revenue per user based on historical data.

🧠 Segment Customers (Clustering):
Identify distinct customer groups based on behavioral patterns to enable targeted marketing.

💼 Business Use Cases
🎯 Marketing Optimization:
Improve ad targeting and promotions by identifying high-conversion customers.

📈 Revenue Forecasting:
Predict customer spending patterns to assist in pricing strategies.

👤 Personalization & Customer Retention:
Group customers into behavioral segments for personalized recommendations.

🚪 Churn Prevention:
Identify potential drop-offs and re-engage users with tailored interventions.

🔍 Approach
🧹 1. Data Preprocessing
Cleaned and handled missing values

Encoded categorical features (e.g., country, product category)

Scaled numerical features using standardization

📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed browsing patterns, session lengths, and product interactions

Visualized customer engagement trends using bar charts and histograms

🏗️ 3. Feature Engineering
Extracted behavioral metrics (e.g., browsing depth, time spent per category)

Created session-based features to capture customer intent
