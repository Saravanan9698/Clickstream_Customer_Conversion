🚪 __Churn Prevention:__ Identify potential drop-offs and re-engage users with tailored interventions.  


### **🔍 Approach**  

1.  🧹 __Data Preprocessing:__  
     - Cleaned and handled missing values.  
     - Encoded categorical features (e.g., country, product category).  
     - Scaled numerical features using standardization.  

2.  📊 __Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):__  
     - Analyzed browsing patterns, session lengths, and product interactions.  
     - Visualized customer engagement trends using bar charts and histograms.  

3.  🏗️ __Feature Engineering:__  
     - Extracted behavioral metrics (e.g., browsing depth, time spent per category).  
     - Created session-based features to capture customer intent.  

4.   🧠  __Model Selection:__  
    🔎 __Supervised Learning:__  
     - **Classification:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict purchase likelihood.  
     - **Regression:** Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Gradient Boosting Regressors to estimate revenue.  

🧩 __Unsupervised Learning:__  
     - **Clustering:** K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering to categorize customers into meaningful segments.  

5.  📏 __Model Evaluation:__  
     - **Classification Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.  
     - **Regression Metrics:** RMSE, MAE, R² Score.  
     - **Clustering Metrics:** Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, Within-Cluster Sum of Squares.  

6.  🌐 __Streamlit Application Development:__  
     - Built an interactive web app for:  
       - 📁 CSV file uploads or manual input.  
       - ⚡ Real-time purchase prediction.
